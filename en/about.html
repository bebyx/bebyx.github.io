			<h1>About</h1>
		</header>

			<p>
				Some clever person said that nowadays there are not much truly creative
				crafts left, and the two prominent are <strong>writing</strong>
				and <strong>programming</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>
				I claim I do both.
			</p>

			<p>
				While I write prose, verse, essays in Ukrainian, I write programs usually
				in C, which is internationally understandable (especially supplemented
				with comments in English; even clumsy <i>Slavic English</i>).
			</p>

			<p>
				So, English version of my personal website is mostly about software,
				namely, <strong>free software</strong>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's the <a href="https://bebyx.co.ua/about.html" hreflang="uk" rel="alternate">Ukrainian version</a>
				of this page, if you're interested.

			<p>
				<a href="https://512kb.club" target="_blank">
					<img src="https://512kb.club/assets/images/green-team.svg" />
				</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				This website is built with pure HTML and a bit of CSS code.
				Automation is supplemented with Shell scripts.
			</p>

			<p>
				Why not WordPress or some static JavaScript bloat?
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's the answer. <a href="https://bestmotherfucking.website/" target="_blank">bestmotherfucking.website</a>
			</p>

			<p>
				I prefer to keep the structure as it's used to be in Gopher. It's really elegant.
			</p>

			<p>
				Hosted on <a href="https://github.com/bebyx/bebyx.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.
				(Feel free to raise an issue or create a PR if you see a typo or anything inappropriate.)
			</p>

		<h2>Contact</h2>

			<p>I prefer email.</p>

			<p>
				Reach me at <u>bebyx (at) protonmail (dot) com</u>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, I have own-hosted <u>bebyx (at) bebyx (dot) co (dot) ua</u>.
				It doesn't work with gmail, though (and, maybe, some other providers, which I haven't checked).
				CC my protonmail to ensure delivery, if you prefer this one.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the way, it's always pleasant to know that someone visits my site.
				Since I don't use Google Analytics or any other tracking software,
				feedback is the only way to know you read this.

				So, don't hesitate and throw me an email if you want to. You're welcomed.
